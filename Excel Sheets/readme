Excel Sheets:
list = the species list 
meta data = the data that we used in the meta-analysis
meta_complete_data2 = the data is a copy of meta data with the r, Fisher Z, and SE columns filled in from the R script Effect Size Calculations
Papers_with_color_and_aggression = all the papers that were downloaded from Web of Science and later pulled data from
species list = file with all species listed


Key for meta analysis data sheet(meta data):
Study = study name (multiple rows with same name and numbers indicate same study with multiple rows, a/b indicates multiple studies in the same year)
Species = genus species 
Color1-Color3 = color polymorphism present from light to dark
Pattern = body, dorsal, chest, or head
Classification = color genetics (melanocortin (blacks/browns), carotenoid (yellows/reds), xanthophore (yellows), or auxilary (blues))
Age = mature, immature, or both
Sex = males, females, or both
Location = location of study (captivity, field, lab-reared, or domesticated)
Season = season of color seen (year round, breeding, or non-breeding)
Aggression Units = how the study measured aggression 

Statistics to calculate effect size:
  sample size (overall sample size)
  stat test (statistic used)
  test statistic (value)
  df1 and df2 (degrees of freedom)
  p-value
  r (correlation coefficient)
  n1 and n2 (sample size of the two groups)
  mean1 and mean2 (means of the two groups)
  se1 and se2 (standard errors of the two groups)
  var1 and var2 (variances of the two groups)
  sd1 and sd2 (standard deviations of the two groups)
  
  Statistics Combinations:
	Means: means, standard deviations or standard errors or variances, and sample sizes for both groups
	T test: t value, degrees of freedom or sample size, and p-value
	Wald: wald value and sample sizes for both groups
	Chi-square test: chi-square value, degrees of freedom, and sample size
	ANOVA: F statistic and degrees of freedom or sample sizes for both groups
	Linear model: F statistic and both degrees of freedom

Color of rows:
  white row = usable paper
  dark grey = cannot use paper based on exclusion criteria (negative of inclusion criteria)

Inlusion Criteria:
  Non-human study
  individual measure of both coloration pattern and aggression against a con-specific
  natural color variation within the same species
  report relevant statistics to formulate effect size estimate
  analyze data in comparison between color morphs
